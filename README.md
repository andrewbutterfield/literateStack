# literate Stack

Template for literate programs built using stack

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need to install `stack`.

See <https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/>. You are strongly advised to follow their advice regarding the PATH environment variable at <https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#path>.

### Installing

1. Clone the github repository at a suitable location

`git clone https://github.com/andrewbutterfield/literateStack.git`

2. Enter the directory `literateStack`

3. Give command `stack install` and wait. The first time you run this might take a while as it may install a local version of the Haskell compiler and required libraries. When it is done it will have installed a program called `litstack`.

## Tailoring

You can then rename stuff to suit your own purposes.
